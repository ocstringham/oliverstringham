Before we can run the CREATE TABLE script, we must first activate PostGIS. To do so, right click Extension –> Create –> Extension

Activate PostGIS

The from the drop down menu, select "postgis"

Select PostGIS

!!!!!!!! in definition tab select schema us_census !!!!!!!!! !!!!

!!! Doesn't let run …. use query tool

After clicking Save, PostGIS will now be activated for the us_census schema.


The first step is open the Query Tool in pgAmin. Go to Tool –> Query Tool.

Open query tool

This will open a blank text editor. Copy and paste the CREATE TABLE code to the text editor and press Execute button (see cursor position in image below):

pgAmin execute create table

You should receive a green message in the bottom right of pgAmin that says "Query returned successfully in xxx msec.". Our table has been created! To view in in pgAmin, right click the us_census schema and click refresh:

Refresh schema

Now under Tables, our new table us_census_county_2010 should be visible:

View created table

Our table was successfully created and now exists in postgres. One quick note, is that you can save the CREATE TABLE code as a .sql to access later by either the Save feature in pgAmin or copying to another text editor and saving there.
