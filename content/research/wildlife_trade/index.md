excerpt: Millions of animals, plants, and wildlife products are moved across the global every year. This trade of wildlife presents serious conservation and biosecurity threats. Removing plants and animals from their natural habitat can endanger populations with extinction. Also, moving plants and animals can result in spread of diseases and produce new invasive species. My research seeks to understand the dynamics of the wildlife trade of live animals, in particular the conservation threats and invasive species risks.
