excerpt: "Invasive species cause ecological, economic damage, and can even endanger human health. Biological Invasions are compartmentalized into discrete stages. My research focuses on the earliest stages of biological invasions: transport, introduction, and establishment. In particular, I explore the consequences of the wildlife trade as a source of new invasive species. I seek to answer questions such as: what makes certain species more common in the trade? Why are certain species of exotic pets released into the environment over others? In addition, I explore theoretical underpinnings of non-native establishments."
