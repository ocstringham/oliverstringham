summary: "We provide comments to The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment on their ‘Proposed amendments to the Appendices of CITES for Australian Native Reptiles’.Overall, we agree with the essence of the Department’s proposal that certain at-risk Australian native reptiles should have international protection under CITES to reduce the risks of poaching, smuggling, and extinction. (1) Specifically, it is our interpretation that the proposed taxa are eligible for CITES Appendix III and would benefit from this level of protection. (2) Our work and the work of other independent scientific researchers has provided empirical evidence that native Australian reptiles are poached from the wild and smuggled across the border to be sold in overseas exotic pet markets. Here, we detailed the scientific evidence for this risk, including published and unpublished data from overseas markets and data on seizures of native reptiles collected by various Australian government agencies. (3) At the same time, we believe that there are additional at-risk reptile taxa not identified by the Department that would similarly benefit from an Appendix III listing. We recommend the Department be more comprehensive in their action against the illegal wildlife trade by listing other endemic reptile taxa that face near-identical risks to the proposed taxa. We provide a list of taxa (21 genera) that are experiencing similar threats (poaching, smuggling, present in overseas trade) and evidence for those risks. (4) Also, we highlight three other areas that we believe the Department should be aware of and consider. The first concern is that the proposal does not address changes in taxonomy that may occur in the future. The second concern is that, historical evidence suggests that any taxa which are newly added to a CITES Appendix face a transitory increased risk of poaching from smugglers who seek to move individuals before the taxa is officially listed. Consequently, we strongly recommend that these CITES listings are accompanied by a temporary increase in poaching and border-smuggling interception efforts. The third consideration centers around how Appendix III can be used as a mechanism to collect data on the illegal trade of Australian reptiles. This data can be analyzed to consider future potential up-listings to Appendix II or I for eligible taxa. We now detail each of the above-mentioned topics in greater detail."
